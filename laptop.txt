8 GB RAM (4 GB is also enough,) As a developer we doesn't require more.
Win 10 64 bit OS
Laptop life depends on processer not on RAM.
Core i5 8th - 10th (2.3+ GHz speed required)
500 GB HDD is enough. (1 TB is better but not required)
At least 128 GB SSD required. 
3 cell Battery (  5 - 6 hrs) 
[ Too hard to find in such budget,
  2 cell (3-4 hrs) ]
Dedicated Graphics (2 GB atleast)

You can compromise in 
		     Battery
		     Hard disc (till 500gb)
